`
I worked on two projects , a weather and check-out list. I create the weather project with python using tkinter and requesting an API.On the check-out list, it was done by using javascript , html and css.
`

Pseudocode - Weather App 
	
`for user enter city/state:`
	
	if user enter a correct city/state
		Print out the current weather , where the city is from , which state 
		and how weather actually feels like
	Else
		Print out notify user to enter a city or state 

Pseudocode - Check-Out List 


`user will add items to the list :
	For user enter item to list :`
	
	if user enter item and press button add
		Add item to the list orderly 
	else 
		An alert message will appear to allow user to know they did not  enter an input
		

	`Can delete/check items on list once complete or enter an error to the list`
